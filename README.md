# hexchess
An exercise in Go to create a hexagonal version of chess.

My goal for this project is to practice programming in Go and to have some fun doing it.

I will be creating a hexchess game that will allow players to play remote games of chess
on a hexagonal board. See planning for more details.

## Project Structure
- `build`: contains artifacts and executables from the build process.
- `common`: contains common source code that can be used by other components.
- `planning`: contains planning documents and api/protocol descriptions.

 <!-- use `tree` to generate the ascii representation of the current directory -->
